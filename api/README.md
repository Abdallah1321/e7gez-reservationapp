# Backend

This is the backend component of the restaurant reservation project, which handles API requests and database operations to support the frontend and admin dashboard components. It is built using Node.js, Express.js for RESTful API endpoints, Passport.js for authentication, and MongoDB for database management.

## Features

The backend component includes the following features:

* API endpoints: It provides a set of RESTful API endpoints for handling various operations such as fetching available tables, creating reservations, canceling reservations, and managing authentication and authorization.

* Authentication and Authorization: It includes Passport.js middleware for handling user authentication and authorization. It supports authentication using different strategies such as local authentication or social media logins, and implements authorization logic to restrict access to certain API endpoints based on user roles.

* Database operations: It interacts with the MongoDB database to perform operations such as fetching available tables, creating reservations, updating reservation status, and managing user information.

* Error handling: It includes robust error handling mechanisms to handle various types of errors such as invalid requests, authentication failures, and database errors, and provides appropriate error responses to the frontend and admin dashboard components.
