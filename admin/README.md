# Admin Dashboard
This is the admin dashboard component of the restaurant reservation project, which provides a web-based interface for restaurant administrators to manage reservations, view booking details, and monitor table availability. It is built using React.js, Redux for state management, Material-UI for UI components, and Axios for API communication.

## Features
The admin dashboard component includes the following features:

* Reservation management: Administrators can view and manage reservations made by customers, including details such as reservation ID, table number, date, time, and number of guests. They can also update the reservation status (e.g., confirm, cancel) based on restaurant policies.

* Table availability: Administrators can view the availability status of all tables in real-time, including tables that are currently occupied, reserved, or available. They can also update the availability status of tables as needed.

* Dashboard analytics: Administrators can view graphical analytics and statistics related to reservations, such as reservation trends, popular reservation times, and reservation cancellation rates, to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.

* User management: Administrators can view and manage user accounts, including adding new users, updating user information, and managing user roles (e.g., admin, staff).

* Responsive layout: The admin dashboard component is designed with a responsive layout that adapts to different devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones, providing a seamless experience across various platforms.
